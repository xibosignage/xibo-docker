## CMS Configuration

## Please make a copy of this file as config.env, and then
## edit it to suit your environment

## The CMS brings its own MySQL server to store your
## data. 
## On a new installation, we need to create a user account for the CMS to
## connect to that database with. What password should
## that account use? Enter a random password here.
## We recommend using a 16 character random upper/lower case
## and digits.
## You could for example use the random.org password generator
## here: https://www.random.org/passwords/?num=1&len=16&format=plain&rnd=new
##
## IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE SPECIAL CHARACTERS, SPACES etc. Please use only
## alpha-numeric (ie A-Z a-z 0-9) passwords of around 16 characters. The
## random generator linked above will give you something suitable.
##
## If you're upgrading an existing installation, be sure to use the correct
## password for the cms user account in the MySQL database (ie what you had in
## this variable previously).

MYSQL_PASSWORD=

## SMTP Server Configuration
## The CMS needs to be able to send email to you
## Please enter credentials for a suitable SMTP server
## Defaults will work for GMail - replacing your GMail username
## and password as appropriate. You will also need to enable access
## for less secure applications on your GMail account for this to
## work. See https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255

## SMTP Server Hostname
CMS_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com:587
## SMTP Username
CMS_SMTP_USERNAME=youraccount@gmail.com
## SMTP Password
CMS_SMTP_PASSWORD=yourpassword
## Use a TLS Connection YES/NO
CMS_SMTP_USE_TLS=YES
## SMTP Check TLS Certificate YES/NO
CMS_SMTP_CHECK_TLS_CERTIFICATE=YES
## Use a STARTTLS Connection YES/NO
CMS_SMTP_USE_STARTTLS=YES
## Rewrite domain (the domain your email will appear to come from)
CMS_SMTP_REWRITE_DOMAIN=gmail.com
## Hostname that we should identify ourself to the remote server as
CMS_SMTP_HOSTNAME=gmail.com
## Can the From line be overridden in the outbound email
## NB GMail will rewrite the From address anyway so it's not important
## for GMail - YES/NO
CMS_SMTP_FROM_LINE_OVERRIDE=YES
## Fix the from email address if your SMTP relay relies on
## a specific value - eg one.com
# CMS_SMTP_FROM=myemail@example.org

## It is sometimes necessary to configure the webserver running inside
## the container to know the DNS name by which you will normally
## access the CMS. For most installations this is unnecessary and can
## be left as default, however, if you know this, it won't hurt to
## set it
CMS_SERVER_NAME=cms.example.org

## Sometimes you want Xibo to run in a sub directory of the webserver
## rather than at the root. If so, specify it here. Comment it out to
## use the web root.
# CMS_ALIAS=/xibo


## Xibo comes with a 2GB limit for individual file uploads
## If you require larger files, uncomment the following and adjust as
## required
# CMS_PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE=4G
# CMS_PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE=4G
# CMS_PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=600

## Xibo can email various reports and charts. To do so a charting service
## is required. Xibo uses QuickChart.io, which has been provided as a container
## in the Docker Compose files.
## If needed, you can change the URL of the Quick Chart service to one you provide
## externally to Xibo's Docker Compose environment
# CMS_QUICK_CHART_URL=http://cms-quickchart:3400

## Xibo has a CRON based task runner built into the cms-web container. It is sometimes
# desirable to run this externally and to do so the internal task runner should be disabled
# by setting this to false. This setting is true by default.
# XTR_ENABLED=false

## Xibo uses a memcache server to act as a cache for resources downloaded from third parties,
# display schedules, required files, etc and for locking resources while they get updated.
# You can turn memcached off if you don't want to use it and Xibo will swap to a file cache in
# the library/cache folder
# CMS_USE_MEMCACHED=false
# In addition, if you wish you can provide an external or alternative memcached host and port
# MEMCACHED_HOST=cms-memcached
# MEMCACHED_PORT=11211

## Anonymous Usage Reporting
# Xibo has optional anonymous usage reporting which once per week makes a request to a server owned by
# Xibo Signage Ltd containing information about the type of installation and the number of displays
# We use this data to decide where best to focus our efforts and to improve the product
# A random 32 character key is generated the first time a report is sent. This key is completely random using
# random_bytes and cannot be tracked back to any particular environment.
# It will send: CMS version, install type (docker/custom), number of approved players, number of each player type
# This is defaulted to true, uncomment the below to disable it.
# CMS_USAGE_REPORT=false
